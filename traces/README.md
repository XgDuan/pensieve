- For actual video streaming over Mahimahi (http://mahimahi.mit.edu), the format of the traces should be converted to the following
```
Each line gives a timestamp in milliseconds (from the beginning of the
trace) and represents an opportunity for one 1500-byte packet to be
drained from the bottleneck queue and cross the link. If more than one
MTU-sized packet can be transmitted in a particular millisecond, the
same timestamp is repeated on multiple lines.
```
An example mahimahi trace `run_exp/12mbps` depicts 12Mbit/sec bandwidth. More details of mahimahi trace file requirements can be found in https://github.com/ravinet/mahimahi/tree/master/traces. In our case, the script `convert_mahimahi_format.py` in `traces/norway/` and `traces/fcc/` can be used. Some samples of preprocessed data can be downloaded in `cooked_traces` from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ss0zs1lc4cklu3u/AAB-8WC3cHD4PTtYT0E4M19Ja?dl=0.

- For simulations, the format should be `[time_stamp (sec), throughput (Mbit/sec)]`. Some sample can be downloaded in `train_sim_traces` and `test_sim_traces` from https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ss0zs1lc4cklu3u/AAB-8WC3cHD4PTtYT0E4M19Ja?dl=0.
